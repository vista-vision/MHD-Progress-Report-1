# MHD-Progress-Report-1

#Solving the diffusion equation in r.

The first file, report1.ipynb has the following:

1. Evolution of |B_i| with time
2. The decay rates for various values of r
   (i) plotted against t
   (ii) plotted against r
3. The spatial variation of |B_r| and |B_phi|
4. The variation of pitch angle with r at different timesteps

The seed field chosen has a random component (changes at each run). The 2nd file, report1bc.ipynb has all the aforementioned components with the boundary condition imposed.
